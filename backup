## -------------- Usage ---------------
##  The script generates a tar.gz backup file of a folder, and according to user's given arguments,
##  can upload it to a cloud service using rclone and remove the local copy.
##
## ------------ Requirments -----------
##  - In order to use the upload feature, rclone must be installed and have at least one cloud service setup in config.
## ------------------------------------
##
##  Usage: backup [-n <name>] [-s <path>] [-u <path>] [-r] <path-to-backup>
##
##  Options:
##    -n <name>  Sets the tar.gz file name [default: "backup"]
##    -s <path>  Path to which the generated backup file will be saved to [default: current working directory]
##    -u <path>  rclone path to which the backup file will be uploaded to (not providing one will skip the upload process)
##    -r         Remove local copy of backup file after it's been uploaded
##
##  Commands:
##    -h         Displays this help and exists.
##
##  Examples:
##    backup "/home/user/important_stuff"
##    backup -n "important-stuff-backup" -s "/home/user/backups" -u "GDrive:/Backups" -r "/home/user/important_stuff/"
##
## --------- Configuration ------------
BACKUP_NAME="backup" # backup file name. date will be added to file name after this string
BACKUP_FOLDER="" # folder to backup (full path)
SAVE_FOLDER="$PWD" # folder to save backup file to (full path)
RCLONE_FOLDER="" # path to rclone folder to which file will be uploaded to. leave empty to skip upload
REMOVE_LOCAL=false # remove local backup file after upload
## ------------------------------------
